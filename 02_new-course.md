### Introduction:

A new course that my school could offer for computer science could be Computer Science (Elective). Currently, we only offer CS in the steam lab, where it is a nearly half day offering, and where students often have to pick between CS and other courses based on their desire to graduate with an associates degree or not. Most who want an associate degree will not take CS, because the 3 period slot conflicts with other college courses they need to finish the degree.

---

### Description: 

This course would cover the material of CS I across the year. The course could likely be dual tracked, with an Honors program that earns college credits and a standard program that does not. In order to expedite content coverage in the course, we would use Python or JS, because of their speed of pickup and ability to use frameworks that allow them to be used for games and other projects that have a high level of engagement.

### Target Audience: 

Jrs. & Seniors who would like to take computer science courses but can not afford the time commitment of the steam lab.

---

### Where it fits in with other courses: 

This would run parallel in many ways with year 1 of STEAM CS, but cover less material. It would not allow for transfer tinto STEAM CS with the goal of receiving CS II credit, as it would not enter into the territory of CS II, and they way I've justified CS II credit for a course than students can on ramp into either year is by covering CSII every year, but more quickly than CS I.
