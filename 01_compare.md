### Assignment:
>Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a prepackaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
>
>If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
For other courses, look around for prepackaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
>
>Focus on the following:
>
>Major differences
>
>Major similarities
>
>Comparative strengths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic particularly better/worse over the other. If both seem equally good then no need to comment).
>
>Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

### My Curriculum:
My Curriculum is a home-brewed course that traverses the requirements for [CS I](https://www.suny.edu/attend/transfer-course-desc/#computerscience1) & [CS II](https://www.suny.edu/attend/transfer-course-desc/#computerscience2) as outlined in the SUNY Transfer Course Description document pro dived by the SUNY System, and approved by our partner College, Tompkins Cortland Community College. I will focus on CS I (CSCI160) in this document. My [course outline](CSCI160CourseOutline.docx) and [course syllabus](CSCI160SYLLABUS.docx) are in this folder, in docx format.

### Course for Comparison:
Because my program is a home brew I felt it would be best to compare it not to a single offering of CSP, but to the CSP guidance to look at how a program based on the SUNY course definitions and see where they differ. As a result, I compared my course to the [College Board CSP Course at a Glance Document](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-at-a-glance.pdf).

### Comparison:

#### Major differences: 

There are two major threads of difference between the CS160 course and the AP CSP course - Content breath/focus and content access.

CS160 is built out of the assumption that the student is a college level computer science major, and I defaulted in much of the construction of the course to focus on the transfer requirements, and the master course outline for TC3 (which is heavily echoed in the course outline). After building the overall course outline to these specifications, I backwards mapped the [CSTA Standards](https://csteachers.org/page/about-csta-s-k-12-nbsp-standards) onto the course where they fit, and expanded out some of the course with areas that were not covered in the transfer standards for SUNY. Most of the standards that did not map to core CS skills ended up being addressed in Units 1, 2, or 4 in my course, and truth be told these receive very little time and focus.

These same topics are covered in AP CSP under the scope of big idea 5 and to a lesser degree in Big idea 1.1. CS160 does little to cover social and ethical considerations, and spends very little time on tie in soft-skills the way I have the course written. Also, AP CSP covers the mechanics of the internet in Big Idea 4, something that I did not cover at all in CS160 (or CS165). CSP also touches on Big-O, and big idea 3.18 seems to address non-p problems, but in looking at a few specific CSP courses, I could not find anything that looks like a non-p discussion. I do not cover Big-O until CS165, and do little more than mention that non-p problems exist.

On the matter of content access, the AP comes at how to look at and access content very (differently) than I did in CS160. CSP is a language neutral course that ultimately could be completed by the students in many of the different offerings of CSP I looked at without producing a real, usable artifact of complex use. Its focus seems to be on skills as a checklist of knowledge, whereas in CS160 I looked for mastery of skills via artifact development. 

CS160 (and its sister course CS165) had the end goal of allowing (and requiring) students to produce code artifacts that showed they had mastered the skills in the course, and that would be lasting artifacts for them, if they so wished. In order to reach this goal we used and learned the whole front-end stack of web development. While this is not in any way prohibited by CSP, the prepackaged CSP courses I looked at seemed to be a narrower scope than CS160 ended up being. At least one of the CSP programs did have supplemental material listed in its description (but not included) that looked like it would allow the program to be expanded out to be large project/artifact based, but this did not look like it was a core consideration of that course, and does not seem like a core concern of CSP courses as a whole.

#### Major similarities: 

Big ideas 1â€“3 from the CSP guideline are very much in sync with the majority of CS160, and to a much smaller degree than CSP 160 covers most of big idea 5 from the CSP guideline. Both focus the majority of the coverage on core traditional ideas from CS. 

---

#### Comparative strengths & weaknesses:

CSP seems to be well-designed to give students an introduction to CS that is in line with computer science 1, while also delving into the internet ecosystem and into ethical and cultural concerns in computing. In this, as a course for students in high school, who are really shaping their interactions with the world and developing their ethical core, it is well suited as a course to help grow a well-rounded individual.

CS160 is much more focused on developing programming and CS skills, and using them in ways that have real world applications. When developing CS160, I had the goal in mind of developing a course that would allow students to continue in college successfully, or develop their skills though other routes such as freelancing or a working internship after leaving school. The focus is on developing a CS skill set and the related experience to allow an easy path to real-world viable implementation when students had concluded CS160 & CS165.

#### What I would take from the CSP guideline:

A bit more focus on big idea 4 stuff. As I said, CS160 did not really cover the Internet as a thing, and topics like distributed computing are starting to move closer to core CS topics, and be of increased value for a course with the end goal of producing real artifacts.
