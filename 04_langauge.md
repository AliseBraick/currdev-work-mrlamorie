### Assignment:

> Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
<br>Answer the following prompts:
<br>What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
<br>What is the language?
<br>How does one write & run code in this language?
<br>Rate the complexity of the syntax?
<br>Strengths: How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
<br>Weaknesses: How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
<br>Why did you select this language for this class?

### Language: Python
>Background: While I have worked with Python on my own before, I have not done so within the imagining of a class outside of the confines of this program, and I have historically worked in Python 2.x, so Python 3.x has little surprises  for me here and there... *not very pythonic of it, btw*.

* What is the course? (grade level, student experience) <br>The course is the course I used to run at my school CSI/CSII for concurrent enrollment credit via CollegeNow, it assumes no student experience, but assumes students have opted into the course. The course is for students in 11th & 12th grades.
* What is the language? <br> Python 3.x <br>
* How does one write & run code in this language? <br> Python can be run using a local install of the Python package via command line or via editor run command on IDLE or a number of 3rd party editors. It can also be setup to run via the run button on [replit.com](https://replit.com/) or via command line there as well, where it can also be edited. A number of replit alternatives can be used as well, such as [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) and other CodeStudio clones, where it can commonly be run via a run button, and which will work on all platforms with an internet connection. <br>
* Rate the complexity of the syntax? <br>Python syntax is a sugared-up version of standard "C family" languages, using white space to replace a number of command words and brackets and so on. It's a fairly easy fill featured "true" programming language for new learners.<br>
* Strengths: How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?<br> Python is great for getting rid of all the extra brackets, parens, and so that students tend to struggle with, while letting students access  the core powers of a full featured programming language. And it's got some great features like generators that could be really useful for some of the more complex things you could do as deep dives with students.
* Weaknesses: How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class? <br> The biggest weakness of python for the students expected in this class is that, much like block language, the relative simplicity of the language could turn into something is no longer a support for learners, but an impediment to development of skills. To combat this, I would use it on a 2-year rotation with JavaScript, so that students who did the 2-year program of the course would have interaction with a more structured, but still forgiving, language.
* Why did you select this language for this class? <br> Because it's really considered one of the more common intro CS languages out there right now, and it has a decent set of features for doing all sorts of things like inheritance and polymorphism et. al..
